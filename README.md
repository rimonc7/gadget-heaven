## ⚛️ React Fundamentals

This project demonstrates several core React concepts:

- **Components and Props**: Modular and reusable components like `NavBar`, `Products`, `ProductDetails`, etc., which use props to receive data.
- **State and Hooks**: State management using `useState` and `useEffect` for asynchronous data fetching.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying UI elements conditionally based on application state (e.g., "Out of Stock" vs. "In Stock").
- **Event Handling**: Managing button clicks for adding to cart, wishlist, and handling filters.

## 🗃️ State Management

This project handles state and data using:

- **Local Storage**: Used to persist cart and wishlist data across sessions.
